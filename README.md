Hi, here are some notes about my code!

CAMERA CONTROLS:
z and Z decrease and increase the x value respectively
x and X decrease and increase the y value respectively
c and C decrease and increase the z value respectively
(it always looks at the center of the terrain)
you can sort-of zoom in and out by alternately hitting z and c (or Z and C). 
I am so sorry for not fixing this yet. I keep meaning to set aside the time for it.
I'll get to it this week!

WHATâ€™S WRONG:
I am still having issues rendering my flock of boids. The boids themselves act
as they should (or so it seems through print-statements), but for some reason
I haven't gotten them to render. My boundaries are fairly 'loose', in that the
flock will get partially outside of the boundaries before rubber-banding back
inside of them. Another thing I didn't get to finish was rotating the boids,
as I was waiting until I could properly see the boids to fix this. I didn't 
account for how long this would take me, and I only started part-way through 
this week. Hopefully we can fix this rendering issue in class but if not, I'll
fix it before I get working on next week's assignment. I will also do my best
to get a functional camera working. 

The good news:
I finally got my textures looking good! Woo!
